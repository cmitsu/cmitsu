<summary> About me </summary>

### Hi there üëã
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on setting up my profile!
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about all things GitHub! (and refreshing my Python skills)
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on developing practical GitHub examples and use cases for the enterprise (and passing this on to others). 
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with practical GitHub examples...ü§î...what I just said...erm...wrote...
- üí¨ Ask me about anything multi-cloud...or guitars. :guitar:
- üì´ How to reach me: TBD :upside_down_face:
- üòÑ Pronouns: He / Him / His
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I think Yoda's "Do or do not. There is no try." quote is dumb. I prefer this one:

>‚ÄúSuccess is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.‚Äù -Pele

<summary> Let's be honest...</summary>

I just Googled that Pele quote. :disappointed:

But I do think that Yoda quote is dumb. 

<details>
<summary>Here's my original "Fun fact:"</summary>

~~My friends call me the human calculator because I can solve complex math equations in my head...jaykay...but that would be neat wouldn't it?~~

And here's a quote a really like: 
>To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true. -Aristotle

<details>
<summary> This is getting out of hand...</summary>

It really is...and pretty much defeats the purpose of collapsed sections...

Actually it isn't blank.
